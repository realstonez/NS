# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey & AI Experiments

Welcome! 👋 This repository serves as a living documentation of my progress in learning **Python**.

I am not just learning syntax; I am exploring how to integrate **Artificial Intelligence** into daily workflows—both professional and personal—and building simulations to understand complex systems.

## 🚀 The Mission
My goal with this repository is to:
1.  **Master Python:** Moving from basics to intermediate concepts.
2.  **Leverage AI:** Using AI not just to write code, but to optimize daily tasks (work automation, data analysis, personal organization).
3.  **Simulate Life:** Creating code that mimics natural phenomena, specifically **Natural Selection**.

## 🧬 Project Spotlight: Natural Selection Simulation
*Status: Active*

This is the core project of my learning journey. I am building a simulation to visualize how traits evolve in a population over time using Python's random generation and plotting capabilities.

**Key Concepts Explored:**
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Creating "Creature" classes with distinct attributes.
* **Genetic Algorithms:** Implementing code where successful creatures pass traits to the next generation with mutations.
* **Survival Logic:** Balancing energy consumption vs. food acquisition.

**How to Run It:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Realstonez/NS.git](https://github.com/Realstonez/NS.git)

# Navigate to the folder
cd NS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python simulation.py
